    description: |2-
        *Developing density functional models for charged interfaces involving electrolyte solutions; Built a python framework for classical density functional theory coupled with surface charge regulation; model treats solvent explicitly and accounts surface charge basing on thermodynamic chemical equilibrium. 
*Observed new physical insights and the steps for a molecular theory to address important features like the role of non-columbic interactions - ionic solvation and surface-ion interactions, on the actual electrostatics of the system i.e. the electric double layer.
